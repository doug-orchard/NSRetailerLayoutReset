#NS Retailer Layout CSS Reset
Version 1.0.0

### Intro
This is a layout reset to correct the problems current associated with the Retailer products from Netset AB.
Currently each column within the 'content' area has a fixed size that equates to the left and right columns to be different in size.
This reset corrects the sizing by removing pixel dimensions and replaces it with percentages.

### Why did I make this?
I was annoyed by having to fix this issue each time a new design was started. Considering the outdated layout of the markup for
the product it becomes difficult to make any design changes to the product. This CSS would be the building blocks making a new layout changes.

### Why add it on Github?
Since it is a global problem, i prefer that this code was available for all to use. Make their lives easier.

### Issues from using reset
If you have already created frames for item-boxes, this will affect their sizing. Since this reset changes the size of the promotions and column sizes,
the background graphics will need to be correct to match the new size.

### Platform Compatibility

### Installation
